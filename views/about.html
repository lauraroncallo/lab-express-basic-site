    <p> Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born on 2 February 1977 in Barranquilla, Colombia. She is the only child of William Mebarak Chadid and Nidia Ripoll Torrado. She is also of Colombian and Lebanese descent.[16][17] Her father William was born in New York City to a family from Lebanon. When he was five, his family moved to Colombia.[18][19][20][21] Her Colombian mother side has two Spanish surnames, Ripoll and Torrado, the former of which is Catalan and originates from four brothers who immigrated from Catalonia to coastal Colombia in the 19th century.[22][23][24] She has also claimed to have distant Italian roots through an ancestor with the surname "Pisciotti".[25] The name Shakira (Arabic: شاكرة‎) is Arabic for "grateful", the feminine form of the name Shakir (Arabic: شاكر‎). She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools.[26] She has eight older half-siblings from her father's previous marriage.[27] Shakira spent much of her youth in Barranquilla, a city located on the northern Caribbean coast of Colombia. Shakira's business acumen is often attributed to a high IQ, which is reported in the entertainment press to be 140.[28] </p> 
    <p> Shakira wrote her first poem, titled "La rosa de cristal" ('The Crystal Rose'), when she was only four years old.[29] As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a typewriter,[29] and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got that typewriter at age seven,[29] and has continued writing poetry since then. These poems eventually evolved into songs. When Shakira was two years old, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident; six years later, at age eight, Shakira wrote her first song, titled "Tus gafas oscuras" ('Your dark glasses'), which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses to hide his grief.[30]</p>

    Shakira's debut album, Magia, was recorded with Sony Music Colombia in 1990 when she was only 13 years old.[35] The songs are a collection made by her since she was eight,[36] mixed pop-rock ballads and disco uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment. The album was released in June 1991 and featured "Magia" and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially, as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.[31] After the poor performance of Magia, Shakira's label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record. Though she was little known outside of her native Colombia at the time, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad "Eres" ("You Are") and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was the then 20-year-old Ricky Martin,[35] whose initial prominence had come from his membership in Menudo.
    Shakira's second studio album, titled Peligro, was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than Magia had been, though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira's refusal to advertise or promote it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school.[35] In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV series The Oasis, loosely based on the Armero tragedy in 1985.[37] Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums.

            Shakira began a relationship with Argentinian lawyer Antonio de la Rúa in 2000. In a 2009 interview, Shakira stated their relationship already worked as a married couple, and that "they don't need papers for that".[257]
            After 10 years together, Shakira and de la Rúa separated in August 2010 in what she described as "a mutual decision to take time apart from our romantic relationship". She wrote that the couple "view this period of separation as temporary", with de la Rúa overseeing Shakira's "business and career interests as he has always done".[258] As first reported in September 2012,[259] de la Rúa sued Shakira in April 2013, asking for $100 million he believed he was owed after Shakira suddenly terminated her business partnership with him in October 2011.[260] His lawsuit was dismissed by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in August 2013.[261]. Shakira entered a relationship with the Spanish football player Gerard Piqué, centre back for Barcelona and the Spanish national team in 2011.[262][263] Piqué, who is exactly ten years her junior, first met Shakira in the spring of 2010, when he appeared in the music video for Shakira's song "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)", the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[259] Shakira gave birth to the couple's first son Milan on 22 January 2013 in Barcelona, Spain, where the family had taken up residence.[264] Shakira gave birth to their second son Sasha on 29 January 2015.[265] Forbes listed Shakira and Piqué in their list of "World's Most Powerful Couples".[266]
            In 2020, Shakira announced her completion of an Ancient Philosophy course through the University of Pennsylvania, describing it as an impractical hobby of hers.[267]
